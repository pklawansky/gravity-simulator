# gravity-simulator

Gravity simulation with inelastic collisions between objects, and elastic collisions against boundary walls. Light simulation as well as solid object rendering techniques implemented to make a crude visualizer. Could be optimised a lot better and make use of graphic acceleration libraries like openGL etc.
